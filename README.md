# Many-Models-Clasification

It is a library for easy to implement classification models. While it reduces the complexity of implementation users can focus on tunning, data preprocessing and others to imporove accuracy. The whole library is implemented on Tensorflow, a scalabel Deep learning Library

### The algorithms implemented in this libraries are
<li>
Neural Network based classification
</li>
